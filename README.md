#3D Rotation Drawing

I tried to create a drawing board with 3d motion and the ability to change colors.

## Summary

In my final project, I tried to use p5 to create a drawing board. For the programming part, I used a lot of variables and if statements to create the rotation and colorful buttons. For the 3D Rotation, I focused on the nod and time past and frequency to create the rotation. And it is interactive with the brush and background.

## Component Parts

I used two different sounds, one for the drawing and one for clicking buttons. This semester's computational practice course required to create an interactive space for users. And I  provides a range of painting materials (such as brushes/pigments/filters) for the user to manipulate to create dynamic/interactive paintings. This painting system is an extension of the concept of "painting", but still needs to reflect the similarity with the traditional painting system.

Comparing the 3d drawing board with the traditional paper painting first. First of all, despite the inherent differences between drawing with software and traditional painting (which was analyzed in the previous blog post by the blogger), 3d drawing board can realize dynamics that traditional painting is difficult to achieve.
The second thing, which is also derived from dynamics, is the three-dimensional sensation. In order to reflect the three-dimensional reality in traditional paintings, shadows and layers of colors are needed to help express. And 3d drawing board in its element movement, will give a person a kind of three-dimensional sense.
Traditional painting also has something that 3d drawing boards can't do: realism. The blogger doesn't know much about the art world, but in recent years, he happened to see the most representative painter of contemporary Chinese realistic oil painting -- leng jun's great works.



## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 1: Write Proposal, flush out initial code for your idea
- Week 2: Changed my original ideas and look at videos seeking for new ideas. Partly finished the basic coding for the motion.
Week 3: Adding more function buttons and sound to completely finish the coding
- Week 4: Present!
 
## Challenges

First of all how to create the right idea for my final project is pretty hard and confusing. In the process of researching of how to create drawing board and research about the function of the drawing board is also interesting but hard. Because it is hard to add the interesting function button and make them work well.
